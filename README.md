## Spotify Chart UI
This repository contains an HTML file that displays the current UI for Spotify's Top 20 most dominant artists. It features images that morph when hover action is detected as well as hyperlinks to each artist's respective Spotify account. This project was done using HTML and SCSS.

## Installation
This HTML file does not need Yarn or NPM to install the application. Simply open the HTML file to use it. If you would like to fork the design, make sure you have a SASS Compiler installed in your Microsoft Visual Studio Code app to convert the SCSS file to CSS. Without the compiler, the SCSS version would not render any stylish changes to the HTML file.

## Project Status
The project runs as expected.The HTML file doesn't display the view, thus, you will need to view the front-end version in the link provided below.

## Live Version
